Track Designer and Genetic AI

This is a program designed to allow users to quickly and easily create a simple race track and train a basic genetic algorithm AI to drive around it.

There should be no need to edit the python files as all parameters that are intended to be changed are stored in *.json files. Documentation is provided to provide a description for what each parameter does in each json file.

To create a track please begin with the following steps.
1) Create all *.json files by running "create_all_defaults.py". This is a good time to edit them for your purposes.
2) Create a track using "trackDesigner.py".
3) To test the track to ensure it is drivable for the AI use "single_player.py".
4) Train the AI using "AI_drivers.py".
